    "# Multi-Modal Factor Regression for Multi-View Data Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository contains code and resources for predicting response variables in a multi-modal factor regression setting, where data consists of observed covariates $$(X_i, Z_i)$$ and response $$y_i$$ values. This approach models the response $$y_i$$ as linearly dependent on a latent factor $$u_i$$, with $$X_i$$ and $$Z_i$$ serving as co-variates that offer complementary information and are conditionally independent given $$u_i$$."
